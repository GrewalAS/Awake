# Awake

## Description
Started the app in 2014 to get a better grasp on programming. The app is an alarm clock app in which you can set create recurring alarms. There were suppose to be multiple ways to turn the alarm off. You could just swipe up on the main screen, you could shake the device or you could walk a pre-specified number of steps to turn the alarm off. The first two ways to turn the alarm off was set-up, but I do not think the last way was set up.

The app was never finished because I lost interest after a while.

The app was built to run on devices with a rectangular screen, so running on devices such as the iPhone X causes some of the screen to not be used.

## To build and run:
1. Open The Awake.xcodeproj workspace with XCode.
2. Select an emulator with a rectangular screen such as the iPhone 8 or 8 plus. The app runs on devices such as iPhone X, but not all of the screen it used.
3. Build and Run

## Notes
- The program was recently updated so that it builds and runs.
